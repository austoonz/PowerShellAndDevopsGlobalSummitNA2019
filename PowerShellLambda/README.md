# Unleash your PowerShell with AWS Lambda and Serverless Computing

In this session we will introduce the PowerShell language support in AWS Lambda before diving into AWS serverless computing. You will learn event driven design patterns and how to combine your existing PowerShell knowledge with serverless computing to innovate faster and unleash your PowerShell!

## Deployment

To use these examples, ensure you have setup a [PowerShell Core Development Environment for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-powershell-setup-dev-environment.html). The [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is also used to help setup the environment.

These code samples are taken "as is" from what was used to present the sessions. There is a base setup script in this folder, ```_setup_.ps1``` that includes code to setup some initial variables used throughout the examples, and to deploy some initial infrastructure for some demos that took too long to deploy live.

## Infrastructure Costs

I have not calculated what costs are associated with the example infrastructure, so be aware that your AWS Account **will very likely** incur costs associated with these examples.
