# PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2019

## Overview

I presented three sessions at the [PowerShell and DevOps Global Summit 2019](https://powershell.org/summit/), two on my own and one with [Steve Roberts](https://twitter.com/bellevuesteve).

## Conference Details

PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit is the gathering of PowerShell + DevOps professionals and enthusiasts. More than just a conference, it’s a true in-person gathering of a vibrant community - we learn from each other, we develop practices and standards, we share challenges and solutions, and we drive our industry forward. If you’re working with PowerShell, Desired State Configuration, and related technologies, and especially if you’re moving your organization toward a DevOps footing, then this is the 400+ level event you’ve been looking for.

## Sessions

* **Unleash your PowerShell with AWS Lambda and Serverless Computing**
  * **Presenter:** [Andrew Pearce](https://twitter.com/austoonz)
  * **Abstract:** In this session we will introduce the PowerShell language support in AWS Lambda before diving into AWS serverless computing. You will learn event driven design patterns and how to combine your existing PowerShell knowledge with serverless computing to innovate faster and unleash your PowerShell!
* **Turn your logs into actionable data at any scale with AWS**
  * **Presenter:** [Andrew Pearce](https://twitter.com/austoonz)
  * **Abstract:** As Enterprises move towards disposable infrastructure, application and platform logs can often be forgotten or lost entirely as servers are replaced. These logs can be an incredible source of information for improving the understanding of your application, troubleshooting application issues, or for triggering external processes such as auto-remediation tasks. However if not captured, this key information is lost as servers are retired or replaced. In this session you will learn how to take action as we use PowerShell and AWS to build a near real-time, serverless data processing platform.
* **0-60 with PowerShell on AWS**
  * **Presenters:** [Steve Roberts](https://twitter.com/bellevuesteve), [Andrew Pearce](https://twitter.com/austoonz)
  * **Abstract:** New to AWS? Do you want to know where you can use your PowerShell expertise when working with the cloud? Come along to this session to see where and how you can leverage your PowerShell skills on AWS. We will cover getting started with the AWS PowerShell modules, demo the use of PowerShell with AWS Systems Manager allowing you to manage cloud resources at scale, secrets and runtime configuration management with Secrets Manager and Parameter Store, and using PowerShell on serverless technologies with AWS Lambda
