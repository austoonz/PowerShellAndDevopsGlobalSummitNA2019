# 0-60 with PowerShell on AWS

New to AWS? Do you want to know where you can use your PowerShell expertise when working with the cloud? Come along to this session to see where and how you can leverage your PowerShell skills on AWS. We will cover getting started with the AWS PowerShell modules, demo the use of PowerShell with AWS Systems Manager allowing you to manage cloud resources at scale, secrets and runtime configuration management with Secrets Manager and Parameter Store, and using PowerShell on serverless technologies with AWS Lambda

## Outline

The code samples here were used to demonstrate different PowerShell on AWS capabilities. Examples include:

* AWS Systems Manager Run Command
* AWS Systems Manager State Manager
* AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store
* AWS Secrets Manager
* PowerShell Desired State Configuration with AWS Systems Manager (AWS-ApplyDSCMofs document).
* PowerShell language support in AWS Lambda

## Usage

To use these examples, ensure you have setup a [PowerShell Core Development Environment for AWS Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-powershell-setup-dev-environment.html). The [.NET Core Global Tools for AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/net-core-global-tools-for-aws/) are used to help setup the environment.
